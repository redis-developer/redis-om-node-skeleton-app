# Redis OM + Express Skeleton Application

Wanna get up and running with an API that uses Redis OM super quick. Just clone this handy dandy repo chock full of Redis OM for Node.js examples and start making changes. Oh, but you probably need to install a couple of things first and configure it and all that.

## Get Node

I used top-level await so make sure it's a recent one! Version is in .nvmrc. I like nvm.

## Clone This Repo

As one does.

## Get Some Redis

Like, stacked, or cloud or whatever, man. Oh, and get Redis Insight too if that's not already stacked.

## Configure

Copy sample.env to .env, edit for your Redis (and change the port if you need too)

## Run the App

npm start

http://localhost:8080 and enjoy the Swagger goodness!

## Change Away
